Welcome. I present to you my blog created with the help of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP programming languages.
Before you try to run this code you need to download it and put it in the htdocs folder if you are using XAMPP. 
You open it using the link http: // localhost / complete-blog-php123 / and.
There are two parts of the project, the first part is the user part where we can log in to view articles and publish, 
and the admin page where it is possible to edit topics, users, etc.
